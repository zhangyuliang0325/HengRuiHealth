## FMDB

If you are using FMDB in your project, I'd love to hear about it.  Let Gus know
by sending an email to gus@flyingmeat.com.

And if you happen to come across either Gus Mueller or Rob Ryan in a bar, you
might consider purchasing a drink of their choosing if FMDB has been useful to
you.

Finally, and shortly, this is the MIT License.

## iOS-Echarts

This is a custom component for the echarts.

# iOS- Echarts - 将ECharts封装成iOS控件
本项目是将百度的ECharts工具封装成对应的iOS的控件，并且将其中javascript的属性封装成对应的对象。方便程序员在编写程序的过程中更加关注OC的代码，避免在使用百度的ECharts工具的过程中过多的关注javascript语法和与javascript之间的交互。

#Echarts信息
